# haskell-tes-parsers

Provided as-is. A word of warning, this is some 12 years old code, I can't remember what it does. Run with Stack: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/

    stack build
    stack run

should run the main code, whatever app/Main.hs points to. There's some parsers for both Morrowind and Oblivion.
